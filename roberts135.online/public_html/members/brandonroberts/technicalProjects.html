                    The projects I tend to enjoy focus on the intersection of music, poetry,
                    and computing. I also enjoy implementing programs in Google Sheets. Shown
                    below are two of the more recent projects I was involved in, one of which
                    I completed as part of a group of four students for a class, and one of
                    which I completed on my own.

                    <p id="description">
                        The poetry generator works by requesting tokens one at a time from GPT-3 based
                        on a user-provided prompt. After each token, it checks if the result is inconsistent
                        with the user-provided poetry format (meter, rhyme) and backtracks if there is.
                        GPT-3 normally struggles with strict poetic forms, making <em>frequent</em> errors in meter
                        and <em>occasional</em> errors in rhyme. This project sought to rectify this by leveraging
                        the fact that poetic meters are <strong>deterministically</strong> verifiable, meaning
                        it is possible to use backtracking or other search algorithms to prompt GPT-3 correct
                        any errors it makes.

                    <pre>My love for language is a thing of beauty,
A passion that has grown with each new day,
For in its depths I find a sense of duty,
To learn and teach in every single way!

The study of its forms and sounds so sweet,
The rules and structures that it does contain,
The way it changes with the times we meet,
A never ending source of joy and gain!

The beauty of its words and phrases, too,
The way they can be used to make us feel,
The power of its stories, old and new,
The way it can make our hearts so real!

My love for language is a thing of grace,
A passion that will never leave this place!</pre>

                    <h3>Analysis:</h3>
                    <p>We can make two observations about the output:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>The sonnet is structurally correct</li>
                            <li>The (rather subjective) quality of writing is not noticeably better than GPT-3 alone</li>
                        </ol>
                    <p>
                        Thus, while the project succeeded in its goal of ensuring correct form,
                        it should be noted that it does not improve writing quality.

                <h2>Maze game in Google Sheets</h2>
                <p>
                    This is an implementation of a simple game in Google Sheets.
                    The specifications of the game were provided by Professor Kane
                    as part of a homework assignment in CSE 101. The implementation
                    relies on iterative-calculation-based ui elements that allow
                    for the extension of Google Sheets interactions beyond what is
                    normally possible.
                </p>
